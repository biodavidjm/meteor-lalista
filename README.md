___My "to-do" list app built using the meteor framework___

# How to use it?

A piece of cake. Just clone the project...

`git clone https://github.com/biodavidjm/meteor-lalista.git`

1. `cd meteor-lalista/`
2. Run `meteor` 
3. And a "To-Do" list will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`

# Deployment 

This is still in progress. I am studying two options

* `meteor build theapp`, which generates a fully-contained Node.js application in the form of a tarball
* Use [`meteor-up`](https://github.com/arunoda/meteor-up)
